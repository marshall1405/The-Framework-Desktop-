#### Benchmarks

Before we start with the benchmarks I think it is very important to mention that all benchmarks were recorded using a **capture card** meaning that there are no performance losses. 

This specific part is divided into two categories. 

- General: Benchmarks taken after BIOS Update, that focus on comparison between the Framework Dekstop
- Before vs. After BIOS Update: As mentioned in the video, I performed all of the benchmarks before and after installing the newest BIOS update and this led to a very suprising performance boost which is talked about in this section
